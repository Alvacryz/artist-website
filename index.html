                    As an "amateur" artist, I simply seek to make better works of art that people might enjoy. Whether it is due to commission work or my artistical whims. As I progress, I would be quite interested in making commission work my side job, since drawing is one of the main passions I have in life. My general work stems from Dungeon & Dragons content because it is where I began exposing my art to other people, and thanks to their donations and encouragement is the reason that I am here today.
                    <br><br>
                    A long term goal for me would be to be involved in some D&D content for a big campaign or the sorts, whether it'd be tokens, maps, illustrations, etc. <b>Something I would really love to try</b> is to make some D&D storytime animations of my own. I'm struggling with the ideas in my head at the moment, but my experience with D&D is still scarce compared to some of the people already putting out this type of content. I'm nothing but a fresh newbie compared to them, so we'll see what happens in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    Surely there's more for me to attempt in the future, but as of right now, I want to focus on the little things I can afford with my limited free time.
